<!---2011 osteosarcoma survivor. I joined the American Cancer Society and California Research to help children who fight luikemia as is my cancer was a childhood cancer. But then after learning to walk and survive I got left all alone, people just wanted insurance money on me. I had my own site blod I started with Google in 2012. I was license on Microsoft word and excell at the age of 15.
I am really just a nerd trying to take up for me and my children and what is right.
